		<div id="description">I am someone who loves to be active, both physically though dancing and within my community though volunteering. I have been training in all styles of dance with the Westlake School for the Performing Arts Center since age four. I have a passion for community service and volunteering, doing service trips during the summer and taking leadership in my school's "Students in Action" club. As for the future, I aspire to become a registered nurse, with a minor in dance. As for coding, I find the world of technology very interesting and believe that learning code and web programming is essential in this day and age; we should not be discouraged to learn based on our gender, but should empower other women to strive for their passion, even if it's unconventional.</div>
